# chiasmus
Automatic Identification of Chiasmus in Texts

This program takes a text as well as other optional parameters as arguments. It processes the text using a variety of Natural Language Processing, density based spatial clustering, and mathematical techniques. It returns a list of all chiasmus in the text along with a statistical likelihood that each chiasmus was intentional. The statistical likelihoods are computed using the Weighted Pearson Correlation Coefficient.
